## Trilinos Background

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
scientific problems.  A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
focus on packages.  Full details of Trilinos and links to package
websites can be found at the
[Trilinos home page](https://trilinos.github.io "Trilinos Home Page").

## Meeting Overview

We are excited to announce that the 2024 Trilinos User-Developer
Group Meeting (TUG24) will be held from October 22nd - 24th, 2024,
at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This
hybrid event will feature both virtual and in-person attendance
options.

## Agenda

 * Tuesday, October 22nd (AM): Keynote Speaker and Area/Package Updates
 * Wednesday, October 23rd (AM): Application and User Talks
 * Thursday, October 24th (AM/PM): Developer’s Day

Morning sessions (8 AM - 12 PM MDT) are scheduled to accommodate
our European colleagues. Developer’s Day may extend into the afternoon
depending on the amount of material to be covered.

## Presentations

We invite you to present your work related to Trilinos. Please email
your presentation proposals (e.g., author(s) and title) to
ccober@sandia.gov and parutka@sandia.gov.  Sharing updates,
experiences, and successes is a valuable part of TUG, and we encourage
submissions for both Application/User Talks and Developer’s Day.

## Discussion Topics

We also encourage developers and stakeholders to submit topics and
questions for Developer’s Day presentations and discussions. This
is an opportunity to address current issues and future directions.
Please send your discussion topics to ccober@sandia.gov and
parutka@sandia.gov.

## Registration

Although this meeting will be hybrid (i.e., attend in-person at
Sandia or online via MS Teams), we are encouraging everyone to come
and join us in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

There is no registration fee, but registration is required for
reporting purposes. Please complete the registration form and send

## Keynote

Tensor Decomposition of Large-Scale Data with GenTen (E. Phipps)

Tensors, or high dimensional arrays of data, are ubiquitous in
science, engineering, and informatics, arising in diverse areas
including multiphysics simulation, remote sensing, text analytics,
and cyber security.  Tensor decomposition methods, akin to matrix
factorization methods for two-dimensional data, facilitate powerful
analysis and reduction of such data, including data compression,
surrogate modeling, pattern identification, and anomaly detection.
In this talk, we describe a recently developed tool for tensor
decomposition of large-scale data called GenTen.  GenTen leverages
several packages in Trilinos to compute tensor decompositions in
parallel on modern CPU and GPU computing architectures.  We describe
the kinds of decompositions GenTen can compute, demonstrate the
kinds of analysis it facilitates, and how GenTen uses Trilinos
packages in these computations.  On-going challenges and future
research directions will also be discussed.

## Tentative Agenda
All times in Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) Denver, U.S. (UTC-06:00).

                                        NVIDIA’s HPC SDK (Graham Lopez) <br>
					                    This presentation will provide an overview of the NVIDIA HPC SDK and its role on NVIDIA HPC systems. We
                       					will look at the design and motivation behind the HPC SDK to understand how and various choices are made
                       					in the product. We’ll look at a few case studies of how support for programming models, new hardware, and
                       					new software products have shaped the past evolution of the HPC SDK, where it currently stands today, and
                       					the future directions of the HPC SDK. Finally, we invite the audience to share their thoughts, feedback,
                       					and ideas on the software.  We'll explore speculative concepts and emerging trends that could shape the future
                       					of HPC application development.  <br><br>
