## Trilinos Background

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
scientific problems.  A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
focus on packages.  Full details of Trilinos and links to package
websites can be found at the
[Trilinos home page](https://trilinos.github.io "Trilinos Home Page").

## Meeting Overview

We are excited to announce that the 2024 Trilinos User-Developer
Group Meeting (TUG24) will be held from October 22nd - 24th, 2024,
at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This
hybrid event will feature both virtual and in-person attendance
options.

 * Wednesday, October 23rd (AM): Application and User Talks
 * Thursday, October 24th (AM/PM): Developer’s Day

Morning sessions (8 AM - 12 PM MDT) are scheduled to accommodate

## Presentations

We invite you to present your work related to Trilinos. Please email

We also encourage developers and stakeholders to submit topics and
questions for Developer’s Day presentations and discussions. This
is an opportunity to address current issues and future directions.
